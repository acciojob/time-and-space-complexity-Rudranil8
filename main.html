	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm.</p>
	<p><b>The Space complexity is the amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve a given problem.</b></p>
